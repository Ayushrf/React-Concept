# State Hooks
- State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.
- To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:
    * useState declares a state variable that you can update directly.

# Effect Hooks
- Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code. eg. using the AOS Library.
    * useEffect connects a component to an external system.
